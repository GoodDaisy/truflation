# Specification: New User Onboarding Flow

## Objective
- Design and implement an intuitive onboarding flow for new users to improve user retention.

## Deliverables
- User journey map for the onboarding flow.
- Wireframes for new onboarding screens.
- Implementation of the onboarding flow in the application.

## Details
- Conduct user research to understand the needs and pain points of new users.
- Create user journey map and wireframes based on research insights.
- Collaborate with the development team to implement the onboarding flow.

## Background
- Our current onboarding flow has a high drop-off rate. User feedback suggests it's not intuitive or engaging.

## Assumptions and Constraints
- We assume that improving the onboarding flow will improve user retention. 
- We're constrained by a 4-week deadline before the next major app update.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The new onboarding flow reduces drop-off rate by at least 20%.
- Users rate the onboarding experience at least 4 out of 5 in post-onboarding surveys.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Users may not find the new onboarding flow intuitive. Mitigation: Conduct usability tests with the new flow before the launch.
- Risk: Implementation may take longer than expected. Mitigation: Start with a minimum viable product and iteratively improve it.

## Timeline and Milestones
- Week 1-2: User research and creation of user journey map and wireframes.
- Week 3: Development starts on the new onboarding flow.
- Week 4: Testing and iteration based on user feedback.
- End of Week 4: New onboarding flow implemented and launched.

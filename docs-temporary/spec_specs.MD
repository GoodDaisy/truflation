# Example Specification: Writing a Spec

## Background

In our organization, there is currently no standardized process for writing specifications. This has led to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in our planning and execution processes.

## Objective

The objective of this spec is to standardize the process of writing specifications in our organization. By doing so, we aim to improve the clarity and effectiveness of our planning and execution processes.

## Assumptions and Constraints

We are assuming that all team members have a basic understanding of what a specification is and why it's important. We are also constrained by the need to ensure the new process is not overly complex or time-consuming.

## Deliverables

1. A detailed guideline document for writing specifications.
2. A template for writing specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria

The guideline document should be clear, concise, and easily understandable by all team members. The template should be easy to use and adaptable to a wide range of specifications.

## Details

1. **Guideline Document**: This document will outline the process of writing a specification. It will detail what information should be included, how it should be structured, and provide examples for clarity. This will serve as a reference for anyone tasked with writing a spec.
2. **Specification Template**: We will create a standard template for writing specs. This template will include sections for Objective, Deliverables, and Details, as well as any other sections deemed necessary during the creation of the guidelines.

## Risks and Mitigations

One potential risk is resistance from team members who are accustomed to the current, unstructured process. To mitigate this risk, we will involve key team members in the creation of the guidelines and template, and provide training and support during the transition.

## Timeline and Milestones

The guideline document and template should be completed and ready for use within three months. We will aim for a draft version within one month, followed by a period of review and revision before finalization.

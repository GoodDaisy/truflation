There should be a structure that makes it very easy to upgrade the docker image/containers. All our modules will use the same docker image, but they will be customized to grab:
> ingestion information
  > sources, parser, constraints
> transformer
  > functions to map/process/calculate data
> QA
  > functions to process and QA transformed data
> Export
  > functions to map tranformed data to db


> Login information
> logging passwords
> general env

My first thought is to save all this as a json file.

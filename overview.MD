# Python Data Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The main class in this script is the `Pipeline` class, which inherits from the `Task` class. This class is initialized with an instance of `PipeLineDetails` which provides the details for a specific pipeline configuration. The `Pipeline` class is responsible for coordinating the steps of the data processing pipeline, which includes ingestion, transformation, and export of data.

The code is broken up into a Pipeline and PipelineDetails to separate the high-level execution of tasks in the pipeline from the specifics of those tasks. Pipeline controls the flow of data through the system and uses PipelineDetails to get specific information about the steps in the pipeline. This separation allows the details of the pipeline to be changed without needing to modify the Pipeline class itself, promoting loose coupling and enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the code.

In developing the Pipeline class and components, all main functionality should be placed in the class and made as general as possible so that it can be reused. When this can't be done, specialized functionality should be passed into the Pipeline through one of the details classes.

## Pipeline Components

The `Pipeline` class comprises several components, each with specific responsibilities in the data processing flow:

1. **GeneralLoader**: This component is responsible for reading and parsing the data from all specified sources. It also stores the data in a cache for further transformation and export.

2. **Validator**: This component is used to validate the ingested data based on certain rules or conditions, which can be automatically inferred -- but need refinement.

3. **Transformer**: This is a function in `PipelineDetails`. It transforms the loaded data according to specified rules or functions.

4. **Exporter**: This component exports a dataframe into a database, according to the export details parameter. Using Pandas, it loads new and old data and determines what needs to be added to the database.

5. **PipelineDetails**: This is an object that contains details for a specific pipeline configuration, including the name, pre- and post-ingestion functions, sources, transformer, and exports.

## Ingest Method

This method is part of the `Pipeline` class and is responsible for the ingestion part of the data pipeline. It executes pre-ingestion functions, loads data from specified sources, transforms the data, exports the data, and then executes post-ingestion functions.

## Versatility

The structure of these components is designed to be versatile. While the `Pipeline` class follows a specific data processing flow of ingestion, transformation, and export, the modular design of the components allows for different ingestion structures. 

For instance, additional modules could be created to handle asynchronous tasks for performance improvement. While the current `Pipeline` class does not support such functionality, the structure of it's components do not preclude it. This could be useful for tasks that do not require strict sequential execution and could run concurrently, thereby improving overall performance. 

Furthermore, the design allows for redundancy, meaning that multiple instances of a pipeline could be created and run in parallel. This can provide benefits such as increased fault tolerance, as if one pipeline instance fails, others could continue to process data. 

This inherent flexibility is a key strength of the design, as it allows the system to evolve and adapt to changing requirements and conditions without necessitating significant changes to the core architecture.

## Deployment

The `Pipeline` class is designed to be deployed as a Docker image. This allows for easy and consistent deployment across different environments, without a need to individually update all of our modularized ingestors. A docker compose file will take this image and  point to a directory containing`PipelineDetails` and a script that will invoke and run the 'Pipeline' class, allowing for a consistent and controlled data processing environment.'

## Repository Structure

The `Pipeline` class and its associated components will be stored in a public repository named `tfi-data`. This repository will also include all the necessary modules and classes for data ingestion, transformation, and export. It will not include the module that will call and run the 'Pipeline' class or the details that get fed to the class. 

The details specific to the data processing, including `PipelineDetails`, will be stored in a separate private repository named `dataloaders`. This separation ensures that the core pipeline functionality is openly accessible, while the specific details and configurations used by the company are kept private and secure.
